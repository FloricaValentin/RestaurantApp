# RestaurantApp

This project is a full-stack application demonstrating a basic backend API using Node.js with Express to fetch some random restaurants names. The frontend is built using React-Native (Expo) ,Typescript and  Redux Tool Kit for state management.

Project Setup

Server :

Start the server  with node index.js

Client:

Install dependencies using npm install and run the client using npx expo start 

You can run the project on android and you will need Android Studio for emulator .

To display the restaurants data I used 'http://10.0.2.2:3000/restaurants'  which is equal to 'http://localhost:3000/restaurants' . That domain is the localhost for android emulator devices.

For emulator I used a Google Pixel 3a with API 35. The app is responsive for portrait and landscape mode as well .
